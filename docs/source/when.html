</span> * Get a trusted promise for `x`. If `x`. If `onFulfilled` is provided then get a trusted promise by transforming `x` with `onFulfilled`.
 *
 * `when()` accepts any promise that provides a thenable promise--any object that provides a `.then()` method,
 * even promises that aren't fully Promises/A+ compliant, such as jQuery's Deferred.
 * It will assimilate such promises and make them behave like Promises/A+.
 *
 * @method constructor
 * @param {*} x
 * @param {Function} [onFulfilled] callback to be called when x is
 * successfully fulfilled. If promiseOrValue is an immediate value, callback
 * will be invoked immediately.
 * @param {Function} [onRejected] callback to be called when x is
 * rejected.
 * @param {Function} [onProgress] callback to be called when progress updates
 * are issued for x.
 * @returns {Promise} a new promise that will fulfill with the return
 * value of callback or errback or the completion value of promiseOrValue if
 * callback and/or errback is not supplied.
 *
 * Returns a trusted promise for `x`. If `x` is:
 *
 *  - a value, returns a promise fulfilled with `x`
 *  - a promise, returns `x`
 *  - a foreign thenable, returns a promise that follows `x`
 *
 * Returns a trusted promise by transforming `x` with `onFulfilled`. If `x` is:
 *
 *  - a value, returns a promise fulfilled with `onFulfilled(x)`
 *  - a promise or thenable, returns a promise that
 *    - if `x` fulfills, will fulfill with the result of calling `onFulfilled` with `x`'s fulfillment value.
 *    - if `x` rejects, will reject with the same reason as `x`

 * with the added convenience that once you've created `result` you can call it repeatedly or pass it around like
 * any other function. In addition, `result`'s thisArg will behave in a predictable way, like any other
 * function (you can {@link Function#bind} it, or use {@link Function#call} or {@link Function#apply}, etc.).
