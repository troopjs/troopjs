</span> * The console interface describes the API of the client&#39;s debugging console
 * (e.g. the [Web Console](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Web_Console) in Firefox).
 * The specifics of how it works vary from client to client, but there is a _de facto_ set of features that are
 * typically provided.
 *
 * ## Outputting text to the console
 *
 * The most frequently-used feature of the console is logging of text and other data.
 * There are four categories of output you can generate, using the {@link #log}, {@link #info}, {@link #warn},
 * and {@link #error} methods. Each of these results in output that&#39;s styled differently in the log,
 * and you can use the filtering controls provided by your client to only view the kinds of output that interest you.
 *
 * There are two ways to use each of the output methods; you can simply pass in a list of objects whose
 * string representations get concatenated into one string then output to the console, or you can pass in a string
 * containing zero or more substitution strings followed by a list of the objects with which to replace them.
 *
 * ### Writing a single object
 *
 * The simplest way to use the logging methods is to output a single object:
 *
 *     var someObject = { str: &quot;Some text&quot;, id: 5 };
 *     logger.log(someObject);
 *
 * The output looks something like this:
 *
 *     [09:27:13.475] ({str:&quot;Some text&quot;, id:5})
 *
 * ### Writing multiple objects
 *
 * You can also output multiple objects by simply listing them when calling the logging method, like this:
 *
 *     var car = &quot;Dodge Charger&quot;;
 *     var someObject = {str:&quot;Some text&quot;, id:5};
 *     console.info(&quot;My first car was a&quot;, car, &quot;. The object is: &quot;, someObject);
 *
 * This output will look like this:
 *
 *     [09:28:22.711] My first car was a Dodge Charger . The object is:  ({str:&quot;Some text&quot;, id:5})
 *
 * ### Using string substitutions
 *
 * When passing a string to one of the console methods that accepts a string, you may use these substitution strings:
 *
 * - `%o`         : Outputs a hyperlink to a JavaScript object. Clicking the link opens an inspector.
 * - `%d` or `%i` : Outputs an integer. Formatting is not yet supported.
 * - `%s`         : Outputs a string.
 * - `%f`         : Outputs a floating-point value. Formatting is not yet supported.
 *
 * Each of these pulls the next argument after the format string off the parameter list. For example:
 *
 *     for (var i=0; i&lt;5; i++) {
	 *       console.log(&quot;Hello, %s. You&#39;ve called me %d times.&quot;, &quot;Bob&quot;, i+1);
	 *     }
 *
 * The output looks like this:
 *
 *     [13:14:13.481] Hello, Bob. You&#39;ve called me 1 times.
 *     [13:14:13.483] Hello, Bob. You&#39;ve called me 2 times.
 *     [13:14:13.485] Hello, Bob. You&#39;ve called me 3 times.
 *     [13:14:13.487] Hello, Bob. You&#39;ve called me 4 times.
 *     [13:14:13.488] Hello, Bob. You&#39;ve called me 5 times.
 *
 * ## Timers
 *
 * In order to calculate the duration of a specific operation, you can use timers.
 * To start a timer, call the {@link #time} method, giving it a name as only parameter.
 * To stop the timer, and to get the elapsed time in miliseconds, just call the {@link #timeEnd} method,
 * again passing the timer&#39;s name as the parameter.
 * Up to 10,000 timers can run simultaneously on a given page.
 *
 * For example, given this code:
 *
 *     console.time(&quot;answer time&quot;);
 *     alert(&quot;Click to continue&quot;);
 *     console.timeEnd(&quot;answer time&quot;);
 *
 * will log the time needed by the user to discard the alert box:
 *
 *     13:50:42.246: answer time: timer started
 *     13:50:43.243: answer time: 998ms
 *
 * Notice that the timer&#39;s name is displayed both when the timer is started and when it&#39;s stopped.
 *
 * ## Stack traces
 *
 * The console also supports outputting a stack trace; this will show you the call path taken to reach the point at
 * which you call {@link #trace}. Given code like this:
 *
 *     foo();
 *       function foo() {
	 *         function bar() {
	 *           console.trace();
	 *         }
	 *       bar();
	 *     }
 *
 * The output in the console looks something like this:
 *
 *     console.trace():   main.js:46
 *       bar()           main.js:46
 *       foo()           main.js:48
 *       &lt;anonymous&gt;     main.js:42
 *
