</span> *
 * A Promise represents the pending result of a computation that may not have completed yet.
 *
 * ## Promise states
 *
 * A Promise starts in an *unresolved* or *pending* state.  For example, the Promise for a computation
 * that hasn&#39;t yet completed is in the *pending* state. At some point the computation will either complete
 * successfully, thus producing a result, or fail, either generating some sort of error or *reason* why
 * it could not complete.
 *
 * If the computation completes successfully, its Promise will transition to the *fulfilled* state, and
 * all consumers (see below) will be notified of the actual result. In other words, their callback will
 * be invoked and passed the result.
 *
 * If the computation fails, its Promise will transition to the *rejected* state, and all consumers will
 * be notified of the error or reason for the failure.  In other words, their `errorback` will be invoked
 * and passed the result.
 *
 * Once in the fulfilled or rejected state, a Promise become *immutable*--neither its state nor its result
 * (or error/reason) can be modified.
 *
 * ## Consumers
 *
 * A Promise can be safely given to any number of consumers, who can register to observe the result
 * (or error/reason) of the promise using {@link when#constructor}, or the promise&#39;s {@link #then}.
 *
 *     when(promise,
 *       function(result) {
 *         console.log(&quot;success: &quot; + result);
 *       },
 *       function(reason) {
 *         console.log(&quot;failed: &quot; + reason);
 *       }
 *     );
 *
 * or similarly with {@link #then}
 *
 *     promise.then(
 *       function(result) {
 *         console.log(&quot;success: &quot; + result);
 *       },
 *       function(reason) {
 *         console.log(&quot;failed: &quot; + reason);
 *       }
 *     );

<span id='when-Promise-method-done'>/**
</span> * Consumes a promise as the final handler in a thenable chain.
 *
 * 	promise.done(handleValue, handleError);
 *
 * One golden rule of promise error handling is:
 *
 * Either `return` the promise, thereby _passing the error-handling buck_ to the caller, or call {@link #done} and _assuming
 * responsibility for errors_.
 *
 * While {@link #then} is the primary API for transforming a promise&#39;s value and producing a new promise for the transformed
 * value, {@link #done} is used to terminate a promise chain, and extract the final value or error. It signals that you
 * are taking responsibility for the final outcome. If the chain was ultimately successful, `handleValue` will be
 * called with the final value. If the chain was not successful and an error propagated to the end, `handleError` will be
 * called with that error.
 *
 * Any error, either a returned rejection or a thrown exception, that propagates out of `handleValue` or `handleError`
 * will be rethrown to the host environment, thereby generating a loud stack trace (and in some cases, such as Node,
 * halting the VM). This provides immediate feedback for development time errors and mistakes, and greatly reduces
 * the chance of an unhandled promise rejection going silent.
 *
 * Note that there are still cases that {@link #done} simply cannot catch, such as the case of _forgetting to call
 * {@link #done}!_ Thus, {@link #done} and the unhandled rejection monitor are complimentary in many ways. In fact,
 * when the monitor is enabled, any error that escapes `handleValue` or `handleError` will also trigger the monitor.
 *
 * Since {@link #done}&#39;s purpose is consumption rather than transformation, {@link #done} always returns `undefined`.
 *
 * @method done
 * @param {Function} handleValue

 * It arranges for `onFulfilledOrRejected` to be called, _with no arguments_, when promise is either fulfilled or rejected.
 * `onFulfilledOrRejected` cannot modify promise&#39;s fulfillment value, but may signal a new or additional error by
 * throwing an exception or returning a rejected promise.
 *
 * {@link #finally} should be used instead of `promise.always.` It is safer in that it _cannot_ transform a failure

 *
 * &gt; **Note**: Promises returned from `with/withThis` are NOT Promises/A+ compliant,
 * &gt; specifically violating [2.2.5](http://promisesaplus.com/#point-41)
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * 	function Thing(value, message) {
 * 		this.value = value;
 * 		this.message = message;
 * 	}
 *
 * 	Thing.prototype.doSomething = function(x) {

<span id='when-Promise-method-progress'>/**
</span> * Registers a handler for progress updates from `promise`. It is a shortcut for:
 *
 * 	promise.then(void 0, void 0, onProgress);
 *
 * **Notes on Progress events**
 *
 * Progress events are not specified in Promises/A+ and are optional in Promises/A.
 * They have proven to be useful in practice, but unfortunately, they are also underspecified,
 * and there is no current _de facto_ or agreed-upon behavior in the promise implementor community.
 *
 * In when.js, progress events will be propagated through a promise chain:
 *
 *  1. In the same way as resolution and rejection handlers, your progress handler _MUST_ return
 *  a progress event to be propagated to the next link in the chain. If you return nothing, `undefined`
 *  will be propagated.
 *
 *  2. Also in the same way as resolutions and rejections, if you don&#39;t register a progress handler
 *  (e.g. .`then(handleResolve, handleReject &lt;no-progress-handler&gt;))`, the update will be propagated through.
 *
 *  3. **This behavior will likely change in future releases**: If your progress handler throws an exception,
 *  the exception will be propagated to the next link in the chain.
 *  The best thing to do is to ensure your progress handlers do not throw exceptions.
 *  &gt; **Known Issue**: If you allow an exception to propagate and there are no more progress
 *  &gt; handlers in the chain, the exception will be silently ignored. We&#39;re working on a solution to this.
 *
 * This gives you the opportunity to _transform_ progress events at each step in the chain so that they
 * are meaningful to the next step. It also allows you to choose _not_ to transform them,
 * and simply let them propagate untransformed, by not registering a progress handler.
 *
 * Here is an example:
 *
 * 	function myProgressHandler(update) {
 * 		logProgress(update);
 * 		// Return a transformed progress update that is
 * 		// useful for progress handlers of the next promise!
 * 		return update + 1;
 * 	}
 *
 * 	function myOtherProgressHandler(update) {
 * 		logProgress(update);
 * 	}
 *
 * 	var d = when.defer();
 * 	d.promise.then(undefined, undefined, myProgressHandler);
 *
 * 	var chainedPromise = d.promise.then(doStuff);
 * 	chainedPromise.then(undefined, undefined, myOtherProgressHandler);
 *
 * 	var update = 1;
 * 	d.notify(update);
