</span> * The `Promise` interface represents a proxy for a value not necessarily known when the promise is created.
 * It allows you to associate handlers to an asynchronous action's eventual success or failure.
 * This lets asynchronous methods return values like synchronous methods: instead of the final value,
 * the asynchronous method returns a *promise* of having a value at some point in the future.
 *
 * A pending promise can become either *fulfilled* with a value, or *rejected* with a reason.
 * When either of these happens, the associated handlers queued up by a promise's `then` method are called.
 * (If the promise has already been fulfilled or rejected when a corresponding handler is attached, the handler
 * will be called, so there is no race condition between an asynchronous operation completing and its handlers being attached.)
 *
 * As the {@link Promise#then} and {@link Promise#catch} methods return promises, they can be chainedâ€”an operation called *composition*.

</span> * The `Promise` object is used for deferred and asynchronous computations. A `Promise` is in one of the three states:

 *  - `rejected`: failed operation.
 *
 * Another term describing the state is *settled*: the Promise is either fulfilled or rejected, but not pending.
